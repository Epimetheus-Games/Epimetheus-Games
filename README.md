## About Us

Based in Portland, OR, Epimetheus Games is a small game not-yet-company that consists of a few middle schoolers. It started out as a team for the Oregon Game Project Challenge, and is now...
...still a team for the Oregon Game Project Challenge! We have currently made 1 game, EyeSore, and are working on another for OGPC Season 17.

Epimetheus Games is currently working on the Season 17 of the Oregon Game Project Challenge, and a demo of our game will be released on our website probably around May 18, 2024.
